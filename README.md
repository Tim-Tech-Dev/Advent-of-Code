> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
> variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming
> language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company
> training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each
> other.
>
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little
> programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
> Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes
> in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
